"May or may not have been seen" if you're not sure why do we need to hunt Devil Jho before locating member? "taking this matter seriously" what matter? Than a boad member is in the forest?

2024/02/28 10:35:08 PM UTC+6	22	6	generated	2	FALSE	5	5	3	3	5	It contains enough information in the sense that the descriptions can generally be ignored and all that matters is the initial four. This description in particular seems cobbled together, unless the Commander is a beast you hunt and not the leader of your band or the Commission.

2024/02/28 10:35:08 PM UTC+8	22	8	generated	2	FALSE	5	5	4	4	5	Not sure why '7' isn't spelled out in the description. I understand it being a numeral in the objective, but in a sentence I would spell it (but I might just be trained old-school where anything under ten is spelled out)																																																						
2024/02/28 10:35:08 PM UTC+9	22	9	real	2	FALSE	5	4	4	4	5	The tone seems conversational, but a slight nitpick would be that starting the sentence with 'and' is a tad odd. Verbally, we do this all the time, but in written form it stands out as odd (to me).																																																						
2024/02/28 10:35:08 PM UTC+10	22	10	generated	2	FALSE	5	5	5	5	5	Description seems a bit out of place, unless there is an Arena in the Jungle (I don't know the game maps), but is otherwise coherent and feels consistent.
