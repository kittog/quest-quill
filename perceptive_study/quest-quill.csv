Flavour text is a bit mid.

Pink Rathians don't turn purple in any conditions - this even isn't one of the typical mistakes non-hunters make about monsters.

Monster selection is awkward here.
3 Elder Dragons and a lavasioth?
Could be good for a troll quest like the old MH games used to have but the flavour text is very serious so this doesn't work.

Quest difficuly is easy for a Devil Jho? Should be at least high.

Quest flavour text seems to imply there is a Board member in the location the quest takes place.

No mention of having the distract the Devil Jho/kill it so member can be retrieved. Just sundenly say ""kill the beast"".
Moreover one could easily infer that the board member is the Devil Jho. Yet we are sent to locate the board member perhaps?

Quest desciption is very confusing. 
""May or may not have been seen"" if you're not sure why do we need to hunt Devil Jho before locating member?
""taking this matter seriously"" what matter? Than a boad member is in the forest?

""Contacting our other members should we learn of their location"" perhaps this is part of a quest line locating board members? But they need to informed of this incident yet they are missing too?

Very confused.

Rajang and tetranodon are large monsters - there cannot be 20 of them in a single quest.
